    <string name="overview">We are now in an advance generation where everything can be possible and done without putting too much effort. We all want to facilitate work without consuming too much time and get exhausted. The common problem of the gardener is that he/she forgot sometimes to drizzle water to the plant where it has a big factor to our environment. It will now be easier to the gardener or the user to grow a plant since with our project, the user will be notify about the status of the dryness of the plants. The user can also update when the last time he/she watered the plant is. With their mobile phones they can water their plants even they are not present in the garden but not too far away.</string>
